## Providing Help: Finding and Reporting Bugs

### I think I found a bug. How do I report it?

-   Check and double-check. Make sure it's a bug.

-   Check that it is a bug in `wannier90` and not a bug in the software
    interfaced to `wannier90`.

-   Check that you're using the latest version of `wannier90`.

-   Send us an email. Make sure to describe the problem and to attach
    all input and output files relating to the problem that you have
    found.

### I have got an idea! How do I report a wish?

We're always happy to listen to suggestions. Email your idea to the
`wannier90` developers.

### I want to help! How can I contribute to `wannier90`?

Great! There's always plenty of functionality to add. Email us to let us
know about the functionality you'd like to contribute.

### I like `wannier90`! Should I donate anything to its authors?

Our Swiss bank account number is\... just kidding! There is no need to

## Installation

### How do I install `wannier90`?

Follow the instructions in the file `README.install` in the main
directory of the `wannier90` distribution.

### Are there `wannier90` binaries available?

Not at present.

### Is there anything else I need?

Yes. `wannier90` works on top of an electronic structure calculation.

At the time of writing there are public, fully functioning, interfaces
between `wannier90` and `pwscf`, abinit
(<http://www.abinit.org>), siesta (<http://www.icmab.es/siesta/>), VASP
(<https://www.vasp.at>), Wien2k (<http://www.wien2k.at>), fleur
(<http://www.fleur.de>), OpenMX (<http://www.openmx-square.org/>), GPAW
(<https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/>).

To use `wannier90` in combination with `pwscf` code (a
plane-wave, pseudopotential, density-functional theory code, which is
part of the `quantum-espresso` package) you will need to download
`pwscf` from the webpage <http://www.quantum-espresso.org>.
Then compile `pwscf` and the `wannier90` interface program
`pw2wannier90`. For instructions, please refer to the documentation that
comes with the `quantum-espresso` distribution.

For examples of how to use `pwscf` and `wannier90` in
conjunction with each other, see the `wannier90` Tutorial.
